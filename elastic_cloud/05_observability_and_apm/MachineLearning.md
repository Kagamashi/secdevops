# Elasticsearch ML Anomaly Detection and Observability

## **1. Introduction to Machine Learning in Elasticsearch**
Elasticsearch **Machine Learning (ML)** enables **anomaly detection, forecasting, and correlation analysis** across log data, APM metrics, and infrastructure telemetry.

### **Key Features:**
- **Automated anomaly detection** in logs, metrics, and APM data.
- **Unsupervised learning models** that adapt dynamically.
- **Forecasting for proactive alerting**.
- **Correlations between anomalies and performance metrics**.

---

## **2. Setting Up ML Jobs for Anomaly Detection**
ML jobs analyze **log and metric data** to detect unusual patterns in system behavior.

### **Steps to Configure an ML Job in Kibana:**
1. **Navigate to Kibana → Machine Learning → Anomaly Detection**.
2. Click **Create Job** and choose a **Single Metric**, **Multi-Metric**, or **Population Analysis**.
3. Select the **index pattern** (e.g., `logs-*` or `apm-*`).
4. Define the **detector function** (e.g., `high_mean`, `rare`, `low_count`).
5. Configure the **bucket span** (time interval for aggregating data).
6. Click **Run Job** and monitor detected anomalies.

### **Example: Detecting Anomalous Log Events**
```json
{
  "analysis_config": {
    "detectors": [
      {
        "function": "rare",
        "field_name": "event_type",
        "by_field_name": "user_id"
      }
    ],
    "bucket_span": "5m"
  },
  "data_description": {
    "time_field": "@timestamp",
    "format": "epoch_ms"
  }
}
```
- **Detects rare log events** by `event_type` per `user_id`.
- **Aggregates data every 5 minutes** for real-time anomaly detection.

## **3. Tuning ML Model Configuration**
To improve **accuracy and performance**, ML models require fine-tuning.

### **Key Tuning Parameters:**
| Parameter | Description | Best Practices |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Bucket Span** | Time window for anomaly detection | Set based on event frequency (e.g., 5m for logs, 1h for system metrics) |
| **Detectors** | Defines how data is analyzed (e.g., high_mean, low_count) | Use `rare` for infrequent events, `high_mean` for spikes |
| **Influencers** | Attributes that may cause anomalies (e.g., user, region) | Select 1-3 fields for meaningful correlations |
| **Latency** | Time delay for incoming data | Adjust if logs arrive with delays |

### **Example: Improving Anomaly Detection for APM Metrics**
- Use **`high_mean`** on `response_time` to detect latency spikes.
- Add **`influencer`: `service.name`** to see affected services.
- Tune **`bucket_span` to 15m** for more stable analysis.

#### **Example: Customizing APM Anomaly Detection**
```json
{
  "analysis_config": {
    "detectors": [
      {
        "function": "high_mean",
        "field_name": "transaction.duration.us",
        "by_field_name": "service.name"
      }
    ],
    "bucket_span": "15m",
    "influencers": ["user.id", "geo.region"]
  }
}
```

## **4. Visualizing and Investigating Anomalies**
Once anomalies are detected, they can be **analyzed in Kibana Observability UI**.

### **Steps to Investigate Anomalies:**
1. **Go to Kibana → Machine Learning → Anomaly Explorer**.
2. Select the ML job and **view anomaly scores**.
3. Click on a detected anomaly to **inspect contributing factors**.
4. Use **filters and time range adjustments** for deeper analysis.
5. **Correlate anomalies with APM logs, system metrics, and transaction traces**.

### **Example: Investigating a Service Latency Spike**
- Navigate to **APM → Services**.
- Identify the **affected service** and check **latency trends**.
- Correlate **latency spikes with anomaly detections in ML**.

## **5. Best Practices for ML Anomaly Detection in Elasticsearch**
- **Choose the right bucket span** based on event frequency.
- **Use influencers** to correlate anomalies with user activity.
- **Regularly retrain models** if data patterns change.
- **Integrate ML alerts** into **Observability UI** and **Elasticsearch Watcher** for proactive monitoring.
- **Investigate anomalies with APM and log correlation** for deeper insights.
