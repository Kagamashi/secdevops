
## **Customizing Views in OpenTelemetry**
**Views** in OpenTelemetry allow developers to modify metric data before exporting it.

### **Use Cases for Views**
- **Renaming Metrics**: Adjust metric names to match backend naming conventions.
- **Filtering Attributes**: Reduce high-cardinality labels to optimize performance.
- **Changing Aggregation Type**: Transform counters into histograms, etc.

### **Example: Defining a Custom View in OpenTelemetry Collector**
```yaml
processors:
  metric:
    views:
      - name: "request_latency_view"
        instrument_name: "request_latency"
        aggregation: histogram
        explicit_buckets: [10, 50, 100, 500] # Custom latency buckets
```
