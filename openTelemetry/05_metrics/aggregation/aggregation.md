# OpenTelemetry Aggregation

## **Understanding Metric Aggregation in OpenTelemetry**
Aggregation in OpenTelemetry determines how raw metric data is processed before being exported to backends such as **Prometheus, Azure Monitor, and Grafana**.

### **Why Aggregation Matters**
- Reduces storage overhead by summarizing raw data.
- Provides meaningful insights (e.g., percentiles, total counts, latest values).
- Optimizes query performance in observability backends.

## **Common Aggregation Types**
OpenTelemetry provides different aggregation strategies depending on the metric type.

| Aggregation Type | Description | Best For |
|------------------|-------------|----------|
| **Sum** | Accumulates values over time (monotonic) | Request count, API calls |
| **Last Value** | Stores only the most recent measurement | CPU utilization, memory usage |
| **Histogram** | Groups values into configurable buckets | Latency distribution, response times |

### **Example: Defining Aggregation in OpenTelemetry SDKs**
#### **Python (Explicit Bucket Histogram)**
```python
from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics import MeterProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics.view import View, ExplicitBucketHistogramAggregation

provider = MeterProvider()
provider.register_view(
    View(
        instrument_name="request_latency",
        aggregation=ExplicitBucketHistogramAggregation([10, 50, 100, 500])
    )
)
```

#### **Java (Sum Aggregation)**
```java
View requestCountView = View.builder()
    .setInstrumentSelector(InstrumentSelector.builder().setName("http_requests").build())
    .setAggregation(Aggregation.sum())
    .build();
```

## **Best Practices for OpenTelemetry Aggregation and Views**
- **Use Histograms for performance metrics** (latency, request duration).
- **Apply Views to filter out high-cardinality labels** (e.g., user IDs, IPs).
- **Optimize collection intervals** to balance data freshness and system load.
- **Test metric transformations in staging** before applying to production.

By implementing **the right aggregation techniques and customizing views**, OpenTelemetry enables **efficient and scalable metric processing** across distributed systems.
