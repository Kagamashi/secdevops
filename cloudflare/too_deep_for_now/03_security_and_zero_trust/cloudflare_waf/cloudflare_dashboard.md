## **Managing Security Events in the Cloudflare Dashboard**
Cloudflare provides logs and analytics to monitor security events.

### **Steps to Monitor Security Events**
1. **Go to Security â†’ Events** to view real-time attack logs.
2. Filter logs by **IP, user agent, country, or WAF rule match**.
3. Identify suspicious activity and refine firewall rules accordingly.
4. Export logs to **Azure Log Analytics** for deeper insights.

### **Best Practices for Security Monitoring**
- **Enable Cloudflare Security Alerts** for real-time notifications.
- **Use Azure Sentinel or Log Analytics** to centralize logs.
- **Regularly Review Security Policies** and adjust firewall rules as needed.

By integrating Cloudflare WAF with Azure-based applications, teams can enhance security, mitigate threats, and ensure uninterrupted performance.
