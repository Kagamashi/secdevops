## **Polish (Lossless and Lossy Image Compression)**
Polish reduces image sizes by removing unnecessary metadata (Lossless) or compressing further (Lossy).

### **How to Enable Polish**
1. Navigate to **Cloudflare Dashboard → Speed → Optimization**.
2. Scroll to **Polish**.
3. Choose **Lossless** (removes metadata) or **Lossy** (more aggressive compression).

**Best Practice:**
- Use **Lossless** for Azure-hosted images that require high quality (e.g., product images).
- Use **Lossy** for websites where file size is more important than pixel-perfect quality.
