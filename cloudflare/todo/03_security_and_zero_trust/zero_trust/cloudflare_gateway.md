## **Cloudflare Gateway for Secure Internet Access**
Cloudflare Gateway acts as a **secure web gateway (SWG)** that protects users from malicious websites and enforces security policies.

### **Features:**
- **DNS Filtering**: Block phishing, malware, or shadow IT domains.
- **Traffic Inspection**: Inspect HTTP/S requests to prevent data exfiltration.
- **Device Posture Checks**: Require up-to-date OS versions, security patches, and endpoint security software.

### **Example: Secure Azure Employee Internet Traffic**
1. Navigate to **Zero Trust → Gateway → Policies**.
2. Create a **DNS Policy**:
   - Block access to known malware and phishing sites.
   - Allow traffic only from corporate IP ranges.
3. Deploy Cloudflare **WARP Client** on employee devices.
4. Enforce **identity-aware rules** based on Azure AD roles.
