## **SSL/TLS Modes in Cloudflare**
Cloudflare provides multiple SSL/TLS encryption modes to secure communication between users, Cloudflare, and origin servers.

### **SSL/TLS Modes**
| Mode          | Encryption Between Client & Cloudflare | Encryption Between Cloudflare & Origin | Use Case |
|--------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------|
| **Off**      | ❌ None                        | ❌ None                         | Not recommended (insecure) |
| **Flexible** | ✅ Encrypted (HTTPS)           | ❌ Unencrypted (HTTP)           | For legacy systems that do not support HTTPS (not recommended) |
| **Full**     | ✅ Encrypted (HTTPS)           | ✅ Encrypted (HTTPS, self-signed allowed) | Recommended if you cannot use a trusted CA certificate |
| **Full Strict** | ✅ Encrypted (HTTPS)       | ✅ Encrypted (HTTPS, valid CA-signed certificate required) | Best practice for security |

**Best Practice:** Always use **Full (Strict) Mode** for end-to-end encryption with Azure services.

## **Best Practices for End-to-End Encryption**
- **Use Full Strict Mode** to enforce strict certificate validation.
- **Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)** to prevent downgrade attacks.
- **Deploy Cloudflare Origin Certificates** instead of self-signed certificates.
- **Rotate Certificates Regularly** for security best practices.
- **Ensure Compatibility** with Azure Application Gateway, Azure App Services, and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## **Using Dedicated Certificates**
For higher security and better trust, Cloudflare offers **Dedicated SSL Certificates**.

### **Types of Cloudflare Certificates**
| Type                  | Issued By | Validity | Best For |
|----------------------|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Shared Universal SSL** | Cloudflare | Managed | Free, default option |
| **Dedicated SSL** | Cloudflare (paid) | 1 year | Better security with no shared domain |
| **Custom SSL (BYO)** | Third-party CA | User-defined | Enterprise-grade security |

**Best Practice:** Use **Dedicated SSL** for production workloads with high security needs.

## **Best Practices for Cloudflare SSL/TLS with Azure**
- **Enable Full Strict Mode** to enforce encrypted connections end-to-end.
- **Use Cloudflare Origin Certificates** to secure origin communication.
- **Monitor TLS Logs in Azure Sentinel** for security insights.
- **Automate Certificate Renewal** using Terraform or Azure DevOps pipelines.
- **Use Cloudflare’s Dedicated SSL** for business-critical applications.
