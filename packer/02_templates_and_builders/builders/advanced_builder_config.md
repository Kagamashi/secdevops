# Advanced Packer Builder and Provisioner Configuration

## **1. Introduction to Advanced Packer Configurations**
While standard Packer configurations handle most use cases, some environments require **specialized builders, OS customization logic, and ephemeral credentials**. This document covers **rare builder fields, edge cases, and advanced provisioning techniques**.

### **Key Benefits of Advanced Configurations:**
- Handles **ephemeral credentials** securely.
- Customizes OS configurations at a deep level.
- Works with **ephemeral builders** for short-lived environments.

## **2. Advanced Builder Configuration**
Packer provides **specialized fields** for handling **custom build workflows** and **rare use cases**.

### **Example: Using Ephemeral Credentials in AWS**
To avoid long-lived AWS credentials, use **temporary credentials** from AWS IAM:
```hcl
source "amazon-ebs" "example" {
  region      = "us-west-2"
  access_key  = "${env("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID")}"
  secret_key  = "${env("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY")}"
  token       = "${env("AWS_SESSION_TOKEN")}"
  instance_profile = "packer-instance-profile"
}
```
### **Handling Dynamic Subnets and Security Groups**
```hcl
source "amazon-ebs" "example" {
  subnet_id = "${lookup(var.subnet_map, var.aws_region)}"
  security_group_ids = ["sg-0abc123456789"]
}
```

## **3. Custom OS Logic in Packer Builders**
When working with **custom operating systems**, special pre- and post-configuration steps may be required.

### **Example: Customizing Cloud-Init for Ubuntu**
```hcl
provisioner "file" {
  source      = "./configs/cloud-init.yaml"
  destination = "/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-custom.yaml"
}
```
This ensures the **custom cloud-init config** is applied to new instances.

### **Example: Windows Sysprep and Unattended Setup**
```hcl
provisioner "powershell" {
  inline = [
    "& 'C:\Program Files\Sysprep\sysprep.exe' /generalize /shutdown"
  ]
}
```
This **syspreps the Windows instance** before creating an image.

---

## **4. Handling Ephemeral Builders**
Ephemeral builders **exist only during the build process**, requiring special handling.

### **Example: Using Spot Instances in AWS for Cost Optimization**
```hcl
source "amazon-ebs" "spot_instance" {
  region       = "us-east-1"
  instance_type = "m5.large"
  spot_price   = "0.02"
}
```
This configuration launches **spot instances** to reduce costs.

### **Example: Using Google Compute Ephemeral Images**
```hcl
source "googlecompute" "ephemeral" {
  project_id   = "my-project"
  image_name   = "temporary-image"
  delete_on_failure = true
}
```
This ensures **temporary images** are removed if a build fails.

## **5. Best Practices for Advanced Builder & Provisioner Configurations**
| Best Practice | Benefit |
|--------------|---------|
| **Use ephemeral credentials** | Reduces risk of credential exposure. |
| **Optimize OS configurations** | Ensures images are pre-configured for rapid deployment. |
| **Use spot instances for cost efficiency** | Saves money when testing Packer builds. |
| **Enable auto-cleanup for ephemeral resources** | Prevents orphaned instances and images. |
| **Use dynamic networking configurations** | Adapts builds to different cloud environments.
