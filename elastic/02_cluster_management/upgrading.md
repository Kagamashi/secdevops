# Elasticsearch Cluster Upgrades and Snapshots

## **Upgrading Elasticsearch/Kibana Versions in Elastic Cloud**
Regularly upgrading Elasticsearch and Kibana ensures **security, performance improvements, and access to new features**. Elastic Cloud provides a **seamless upgrade process** via the cloud console.

### **Upgrade Process in Elastic Cloud Console**
1. **Log in** to [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/).
2. **Navigate to Deployments** → Select your cluster.
3. Under **Version**, click **Upgrade**.
4. Review the recommended version and **click Upgrade**.
5. Elastic Cloud performs a rolling upgrade **without downtime**.

### **Best Practices for Safe Upgrades**
- **Check Compatibility** → Ensure that plugins, mappings, and custom integrations work with the new version.
- **Review Release Notes** → Read the [Elasticsearch Release Notes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/release-notes.html).
- **Perform a Test Upgrade** → Create a **staging cluster** to validate changes before upgrading production.
- **Monitor Performance Post-Upgrade** → Use **Kibana monitoring** and **Elasticsearch logs** to track issues.

### **Downgrade Considerations**
- Elasticsearch does **not support direct downgrades**.
- To revert, **restore from a snapshot** (explained below).

## **Snapshot Management in Elastic Cloud**
Snapshots are **automated backups** of Elasticsearch indices and configurations, essential for disaster recovery and upgrades.

### **Types of Snapshots**
| Snapshot Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Automated Snapshots** | Taken every **30 minutes**, retained for **7 days** (default in Elastic Cloud). |
| **Manual Snapshots** | User-initiated backups for long-term storage or specific milestones. |

### **Creating a Manual Snapshot**
1. **Go to Elastic Cloud Console** → Select **Deployments**.
2. **Open Snapshot Management** in **Kibana**.
3. Click **Create Snapshot**, provide a name, and select **indices** to back up.
4. Click **Take Snapshot** and wait for completion.

### **Restoring from a Snapshot**
1. **Go to Snapshot Management** in **Kibana**.
2. Select a snapshot and click **Restore**.
3. Choose specific indices or full-cluster restoration.
4. Click **Restore Snapshot** and wait for the process to complete.

### **Snapshot Repository Management**
- Elastic Cloud provides a **built-in snapshot repository**.
- For **external backups**, configure an **S3, Azure Blob, or GCS repository**.

#### **Example: Registering an S3 Snapshot Repository**
```json
PUT _snapshot/my_s3_repository
{
  "type": "s3",
  "settings": {
    "bucket": "my-elasticsearch-backups",
    "region": "us-west-1"
  }
}
```

## **Best Practices for Snapshot and Upgrade Management**
- **Schedule regular snapshots** to protect against accidental data loss.
- **Before upgrading**, take a **manual snapshot** to ensure rollback options.
- **Test snapshots** by restoring to a non-production cluster.
- **Use snapshot lifecycle policies** to automate retention and cleanup.
