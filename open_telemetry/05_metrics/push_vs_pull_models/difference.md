# OpenTelemetry Push vs. Pull Models

## **Understanding Push and Pull Models in OpenTelemetry**
OpenTelemetry supports two primary methods for exporting metrics: **push-based** and **pull-based** models. The choice depends on the observability backend and system architecture.

### **Push Model (Push-Based Metrics Exporting)**
- **Metrics are sent (pushed) from the application to the backend at regular intervals.**
- Typically used for **cloud-based observability platforms** (e.g., Azure Monitor, Datadog, OTLP exporters).
- Ensures **low-latency metric delivery**.

### **Pull Model (Pull-Based Metrics Scraping)**
- **The backend (e.g., Prometheus) fetches (pulls) metrics from the application on demand.**
- Requires exposing an **HTTP endpoint** with collected metrics.
- Works well with **Prometheus-style monitoring**.

## **Comparing Push vs. Pull Models**
| Feature | Push Model | Pull Model (Scraping) |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| **How it Works** | Metrics are **sent** to a backend | Backend **fetches** metrics from an endpoint |
| **Use Case** | Cloud-based monitoring (Azure Monitor, Datadog) | Prometheus, Grafana |
| **Overhead** | Slightly higher due to periodic data sending | Lower as metrics are pulled on demand |
| **Latency** | Lower (real-time metric streaming) | Higher (depends on scraping interval) |
| **Setup Complexity** | Simple (backend handles storage) | Requires configuring an exposed metrics endpoint |

## **Best Practices for Push and Pull Metrics Collection**
### **For Push-Based Metrics:**
- **Set appropriate push intervals** (e.g., every 5-10 seconds for real-time insights, longer for less critical data).
- **Use batching** to reduce exporter overhead and network traffic.
- **Ensure backpressure handling** to avoid overwhelming the backend.

### **For Pull-Based Metrics (Scraping):**
- **Expose only necessary metrics** to reduce data volume.
- **Optimize scrape intervals** (default is 15s in Prometheus; reduce for high-frequency monitoring).
- **Use relabeling rules** in Prometheus to filter out unnecessary labels.

By choosing **the right model (push or pull)** and optimizing metric collection, OpenTelemetry ensures efficient monitoring and observability across distributed systems.
