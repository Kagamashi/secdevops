# OpenTelemetry Advanced Log Configurations

## **1. Introduction to Advanced Log Processing**
OpenTelemetry enables **advanced log filtering, sampling, and integration** with managed log solutions like **Elastic Cloud**. These configurations help optimize log storage, reduce noise, and improve performance.

### **Key Benefits:**
- **Reduce log ingestion costs** by filtering unnecessary logs.
- **Improve system performance** with log sampling.
- **Integrate with managed logging solutions** like Elastic Cloud.

## **2. Filtering Logs at the OpenTelemetry Collector**
Filtering logs at the **collector level** allows excluding unnecessary data before sending logs to a backend.

### **Example: Dropping Debug-Level Logs**
```yaml
processors:
  filter/logs:
    logs:
      exclude:
        match_type: strict
        record_attributes:
          - key: severity
            value: "DEBUG"
```

### **Example: Keeping Only Error and Warning Logs**
```yaml
processors:
  filter/logs:
    logs:
      include:
        match_type: regexp
        record_attributes:
          - key: severity
            value: "(ERROR|WARN)"
```

## **3. Log Sampling at the OpenTelemetry Collector**
Log sampling helps **reduce data volume** while maintaining useful logs.

### **Example: Sampling 10% of All Logs**
```yaml
processors:
  probabilistic_sampler/logs:
    sampling_percentage: 10
```

### **Example: Sampling 50% of Debug Logs, 100% of Error Logs**
```yaml
processors:
  tail_sampling:
    policies:
      - name: sample-debug
        type: probabilistic
        probabilistic:
          sampling_percentage: 50
        match:
          record_attributes:
            - key: severity
              value: "DEBUG"
      - name: sample-errors
        type: status_code
        status_code:
          status: ERROR
          sampling_percentage: 100
```
