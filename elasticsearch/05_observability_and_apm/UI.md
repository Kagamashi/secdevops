## **Introduction to Logs and Metrics in Elasticsearch**
Elasticsearch, together with **Beats**, **Elastic Agent**, and **Kibana Observability UI**, enables real-time **log aggregation, metrics collection, and system monitoring**.

### **Key Features:**
- Centralized **log shipping** from various sources.
- Collection of **system, application, and infrastructure metrics**.
- Visualization using **Observability UI (Logs, Metrics, and Uptime dashboards)**.
- Integration with **Kibana Machine Learning** for anomaly detection.

## **Using Kibana Observability UI (Logs, Metrics, Uptime)**
Kibana provides a dedicated **Observability UI** for managing logs, metrics, and service availability.

### **Accessing the Observability UI**
1. Open **Kibana** and navigate to **Observability â†’ Logs/Metrics/Uptime**.
2. Select **Logs** to view log streams.
3. Select **Metrics** to visualize infrastructure health.
4. Select **Uptime** to monitor service availability.

### **Analyzing Logs in Kibana Logs UI**
- **Live streaming logs** from different sources.
- **Search and filter logs** using Kibana Query Language (KQL).
- **Anomaly detection** on log patterns.

### **Monitoring Metrics in Kibana Metrics UI**
- **View CPU, memory, disk, and network usage**.
- **Create threshold-based alerts** for metric changes.
- **Correlate logs with metrics for deeper insights**.

### **Tracking Service Availability in Uptime UI**
- Uses **Heartbeat** to check service health.
- Monitors **HTTP, ICMP, and TCP availability**.
- Generates **alerts when services go down**.
