# Elasticsearch Ingestion Pipelines and Transforms

## **1. Introduction to Ingest Pipelines**
Ingest pipelines in Elasticsearch allow for **pre-processing** documents before indexing. This helps with **data enrichment, transformations, and cleanup** using an **ingest node**.

### **Key Benefits:**
- Modify documents before indexing.
- Add, remove, or transform fields dynamically.
- Perform **geo-enrichment, timestamp adjustments, or content extraction**.
- Reduce the need for reprocessing downstream.

---

## **2. Defining an Ingest Pipeline**
An ingest pipeline consists of **processors** that execute transformations on documents.

### **Example: Creating a Basic Ingest Pipeline**
```json
PUT _ingest/pipeline/my_pipeline
{
  "description": "Pipeline to clean and enrich logs",
  "processors": [
    {
      "set": {
        "field": "processed_at",
        "value": "{{_ingest.timestamp}}"
      }
    },
    {
      "rename": {
        "field": "user",
        "target_field": "user_id"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
### **Explanation:**
- **Set Processor** → Adds a timestamp field at ingest time.
- **Rename Processor** → Renames the `user` field to `user_id`.

### **Simulating an Ingest Pipeline Execution**
```json
POST _ingest/pipeline/my_pipeline/_simulate
{
  "docs": [
    {
      "_source": { "user": "1234" }
    }
  ]
}
```

## **3. Common Ingest Pipeline Processors**
| Processor | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Set** | Adds a field with a static or dynamic value. |
| **Rename** | Changes the name of an existing field. |
| **Convert** | Converts field data types (e.g., string to integer). |
| **GeoIP** | Enriches documents with geolocation data from IPs. |
| **Date** | Parses and normalizes timestamp formats. |
| **Remove** | Deletes a field from a document. |
| **Script** | Runs a custom Painless script for transformations. |

### **Example: GeoIP Enrichment Pipeline**
```json
PUT _ingest/pipeline/geoip_pipeline
{
  "description": "Add geo-location to logs",
  "processors": [
    {
      "geoip": {
        "field": "client_ip",
        "target_field": "geo"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## **Best Practices for Ingest Pipelines & Transforms**
- Use **ingest pipelines** for **pre-processing** to reduce query-time transformations.
- Apply **GeoIP or timestamp normalization** to logs for better searchability.
- Use **Transforms for aggregating high-volume data** and creating summarized views.
- Monitor **pipeline execution times** to prevent indexing delays.
- Use **simulate API** before deploying pipelines to validate transformations.
