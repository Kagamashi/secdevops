# Elasticsearch Index Management and ILM

## **Introduction to Index Management in Elasticsearch**
Index management in Elasticsearch involves **creating, configuring, and maintaining** indexes efficiently. **Index Lifecycle Management (ILM)** helps automate the movement of data through different storage tiers (hot, warm, cold) to optimize cost and performance.

## **Creating Indexes in Elasticsearch**
Indexes are logical storage units for documents. They are created with specific mappings and settings.

### **Basic Index Creation**
```json
PUT my_index
{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 3,
    "number_of_replicas": 1
  }
}
```

### **Setting Up Mappings for Data Types**
```json
PUT my_index
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "timestamp": { "type": "date" },
      "message": { "type": "text" },
      "user_id": { "type": "keyword" }
    }
  }
}
```

## **Best Practices for Index Management and ILM**
- Use **index templates** to enforce consistent mappings.
- Implement **ILM policies** to optimize **cost and performance**.
- Monitor **index rollover conditions** to avoid large, inefficient indexes.
- Use **data tiers effectively** to store logs and time-series data efficiently.
