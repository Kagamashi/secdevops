# Kibana Saved Objects and Spaces

## **1. Introduction to Saved Objects in Kibana**
Kibana allows users to save and manage **dashboards, visualizations, searches, and queries** as **Saved Objects**. These objects can be reused, shared, and organized efficiently.

### **Key Benefits of Saved Objects:**
- Allows **reusing visualizations and dashboards**.
- Enables **version control and backup** of dashboards.
- Supports **export/import** for easy migration.

## **2. Managing Saved Objects in Kibana**

### **Accessing Saved Objects**
1. Navigate to **Kibana → Stack Management → Saved Objects**.
2. Here, you can view, search, edit, and manage saved objects.

### **Saving a Visualization or Search**
- When creating a **visualization, dashboard, or search**, click **Save**.
- Provide a **name and optional description**.
- The object is now available in **Saved Objects** for reuse.

### **Exporting and Importing Saved Objects**
- **Exporting:**
  ```sh
  Export saved objects from Kibana UI → Stack Management → Saved Objects → Export
  ```
- **Importing:**
  ```sh
  Navigate to Saved Objects → Import and upload a JSON file.
  ```

### **Deleting and Updating Saved Objects**
- Objects can be **deleted** from the **Saved Objects menu**.
- Edits can be made using **Kibana Console API** or UI.

- **Regularly export saved objects** for backup and migration.
- **Control user permissions** per space for better security.
- **Avoid clutter** by deleting unused saved objects.
- **Use naming conventions** for better organization (e.g., `TeamX-Dashboard`).
